#+SUMMARY: Compare the files within two folders.
#+HREF: incremental-update

* About this algorithm

This algorithm aims to compare the files within two folders. The files within B folder are more than the A folder. Put these files which are not in A folder into a separate folder C. If files already in C folder, pass it.

** How

Use the nature and operation of the collection.

* Implemented in Python

* Why this

A friend of mine wants to use it to do something interesting (I'm not sure...).
